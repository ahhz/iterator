    <title>Summary</title>

    <para>The key objective of this library is to make rasters available as
    ranges. However, the C++ concepts of ranges and iterators are still in
    flux and the current ones not very useful for iteration with proxy
    references (http://ericniebler.com/category/ranges/). Therefore the
    concepts are used in a rather lose sense. Hopefully in the future there
    will be useful concepts for ranges and iterators that we can adapt
    to.</para>

    <para>In the meanwhile, keep in mind that the iterators and ranges used
    here are useful for iterating over raster datasets, but do not conform to
    STL concepts, and should not be used with STL algorithms, like
    std::sort.</para>
